// Outdated style of using strings

const name = "Anshuman"
const rollNo = "23CH10006"

//     console.log(name + " and the roll no is " + rollNo);

// The upper technique is an outdated style of concatenating strings

// The modern method includes

    // console.log(`My name is ${name}, and my roll no is ${rollNo}`);

// ONE MORE METHOD FOR DECLARING STRINGS
let userName = new String("anshu..");
    console.log(`${userName}`);

// In strings, the objects are accessed according to array indexing, but they should not be confused with array.
// Strings are the objects. The index and the element are the key-value pairs.
